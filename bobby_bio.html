        <p> My all time favorite musical artist! What can I say about Bobby Mcferrin in 200 words or less? His musical talent is astounding with a range most people only dream about achieving. Bobby has released 14 albums and collaborated with countless musical groups and solo artists. He is know for his ability to create magic along right along with his audience members. While his discography is impressive, it's Bobby's live performances, frequently posted on youtube, that bring all the "feels" and resonates best. I have attended three of his concerts with each time being a totally different experience.    I could go on and on about the talents of Bobby McFerrin however, in the interest of keeping it short,  in a nutshell, Bobby McFerrin is a master musical shaman that the world could benefit from in the most positive way possible.</p>
