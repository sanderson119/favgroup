             <h1>Review</h1>
             <p id="intro">
             <p>About 10 years ago was when I first stumbled upon the above video while of course, searching fo new Bobby McFerrin music. The performance at McNally Smith College of Music with faculty member, then known as, Judi Donaghy.</p>
             <p>At the time she was relatively unknownn however, this isn't the case anymore. I remember sharing the video with co workers and feeling smiles within my body whenever I listened.  Bobby Mcferrin is responsible for bringing her to the spot light however it's Judi's voice that keeps her there.. 
               Judi is now known as Judy Vinar and is the newest member of Gimme 5, joining only a couple years ago. Judi is an amazing addition to an already stellar troupe of musicians.</p>

            <p>The above video is a simplistic and beutifully sung well known song performed along withBobby McFerrin. <em>I was there!</em></p>
