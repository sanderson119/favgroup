        <h1>Review</h1>
        
        <p id="intro"></p>Joey Blake, who is an acting associate professor at Berklee College of Music has been involved with many projects along with Bobby McFerrin. Joey was a founding member of Voicestra, SoVo'So' and WeBe3, (now Gimme5).<br>
        <p>I have also seen this gentleman live and listen to quite a bit of his content on YouTube.Another astounding member of Gimme5, Joey is responsible for keeping that improvised music on a certain track as a bass singer. He is a master of improvisation along with every other member of this musical group. While Joey is known as a base, under Bobby McFerrin's tutelage, he also has a wide range and hits the soprano notes in what seems like an effortless manner.</p><br>
