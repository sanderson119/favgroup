            <h1>Review</h1>
        
             <p id="intro"><p>Rhiannon comes in at a close 2nd to Bobby McFerrin as one of my favorite musical artists. She came up with Bobby as a member of the musical group "Voicestra" in the 80's, as did Judy Donaghy, in the late 90's. Rhiannon has a number of albums, that range from instructional, to solo artistry, to singing with friends and fellow Gimme 5 members.</p> 

            <p>Her vocal range is astounding and is comparable to Bobby McFerrin's which is no mystery as Bobby along with singing with many other musicians, is also a master teacher that ensures fellow musicians are always improving upon their skills.  As a result, Rhiannon has thrived as a student and is in her element as a teacher. Her resume ranges from Berklee School of music professor, worldwide musical artist to workshop instructor on her lovely farm in Hawaii other locations in the U.S, mostly in upstate New York at the Omega Institute. It is my dream to one day  become a student of Rhiannon's.
